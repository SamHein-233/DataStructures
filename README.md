# DataStructures
A collection of C++ coding files I've completed in my Data Structures Class taken Summer 2024

Lab 1 folder consists two seperate files, Lab and HW. In the lab I developed a function that tells if an integer is a prime number or not, and then created a function to find the 10001st prime number.
In the HW I created a function that printed 40 prime numbers generated from a formula, then printed 80 prime numbers from a formula. Lastly, a function that takes in an integer and returns whether the given number is prime or not.

Lab 2 folder consists two seperate files, Lab and HW. In the Lab I implemented a vector class internally by using dynamic array. Then I converted that same class into a template class
In the HW I created a function the returns the pascal triangle, then I created another function that takes two vectors as parameters and returns a vector of Boolean type

Lab 3 folder consists two seperate files, Lab and HW. In the Lab I implemented a singly linked list that was for a playlist, so the each Node was a song, and the next pointer pointed to the next song in the playlist.
In the HW I developed a function that takes two Node pointers and returns another one. Then I implemented a function that would take in a linked list with numbers and then re-arrange the list to print even then odd.

Lab 4 folder consists two seperate files, Lab and HW. In the lab I created a function for converting a given decimal number and print out the hexadecimal representation.
In the HW I designed a function that takes in a string of parentheses and returns whether the given strings is balanced. Then I created a doubly linked list.

Lab 5 folder consists two seperate files, Lab and HW. In the lab I implemented a circular linked list.
In the HW I wrote a program that converted postfix expression to an infix expression using stack. Then I implemented a queue with many functions for it's elements.

Lab 6 folder consists two seperate files, Lab and HW. In the lab I designed a function that when given a root of a binary search tree it determined if the BST was valid. Then created a function that found the min and max value of BST.
In the HW I implemented a binary search tree

Lab 7 folder consists of one file. In the lab I created a function that would find frequencies of individual words.
